UEFI:
  * TPM enabled (otherwise there is one less SSDT)
  * "Thunderbolt BIOS Assist" enabled (reduces power draw)

Clover:
  drivers64UEFI:
    NvmExpressDxe-64.efi, ApfsDriverLoader-64.efi, AptioMemoryFix-64.efi
    (or OsxAptioFixDrv-64 + EmuVariableUefi-64 instead of AptioMemoryFix-64)
  ACPI:
    patched DSDT + orig SSDTs (nothing to patch) + SSDT-PNLF.aml
    (set SSDR order in config.plist accordingly)
  kexts:
    basic: FakeSMC.kext (with all sensor plugins)
    battery: ACPIBatteryManager.kext
    brightness: AppleBacklightInjector.kext (installed to /L/E per Rehab's guide - don't know if Clover works)
    audio: VoodooHDA.kext
    iGPU: Lilu.kext + WhateverGreen.kext
    USB (enables touchscreen & bluetooth): Lilu.kext + USBInjectAll.kext (+ ports patch or SSDT; fixes type-C 5Gbps)
    keyboard/touchpad/trackpad: VoodooPS2Controller.kext
    Ethernet: IntelMausiEthernet.kext
    Wifi: AirportBrcmFixup.kext (with Clover kext patches; see toledo's guide at tonymacx86)
    BT: BrcmFirmwareData.kext + BrcmPatchRAM2.kext (see above guide)

Status:
  most features work
  sleep/resume: works; lid might be reversed (close then open -> triggers sleep); may have batt drain
  HDMI: video out works (both HDMI port and via first type-C); audio is muted
  speaker & mic: works w/ VoodooHDA; need to set PCM=100, iGain=0, Rec=50
  headphone/mic combo jack: works; detection/auto-switch covers spkr/hp but not the mic
  USB: most stuff work with patching; second type-C can only be used for charging
  HID: no scrolling support (both trackpad & trackpoint used as standard mouse; tluck's fork didn't help)
    TODO - make PrtSc disable TrackPad _only_
    TODO - make TrackPoint mid button scroll work
  DP output via type-C: untested
  Handover etc: untested
